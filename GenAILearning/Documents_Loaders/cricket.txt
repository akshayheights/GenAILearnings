Cricket is a popular sport that originated in England and has become a global sensation, especially in countries like India, Australia, and England. It is played between two teams of eleven players each on a field with a pitch at the center. The game involves a bat and ball, with the primary goal of scoring more runs than the opposing team. The team that bats tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between wickets, while the fielding team tries to dismiss the batsmen and prevent runs.
